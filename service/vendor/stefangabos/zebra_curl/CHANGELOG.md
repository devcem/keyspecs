- fixed an issue where SSL certificate checking (CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER) was disabled by default; now it is enabled by default; thanks **Daniel Stenberg**
- added [delete](https://stefangabos.github.io/Zebra_cURL/Zebra_cURL/Zebra_cURL.html#methoddelete) and [put](https://stefangabos.github.io/Zebra_cURL/Zebra_cURL/Zebra_cURL.html#methodput) methods for making DELETE and PUT requests
- added [scrap](https://stefangabos.github.io/Zebra_cURL/Zebra_cURL/Zebra_cURL.html#methodscrap) method for quickly making a single [get](https://stefangabos.github.io/Zebra_cURL/Zebra_cURL/Zebra_cURL.html#methodget) request without the need of a callback function; thanks **Alexey Dorokhov**

## version 1.3.1 (February 03, 2015)

- Fixed a bug where setting any value to the "pause_interval" property would result in no requests being processed

## version 1.3.0 (January 31, 2015)

-  changed how the "post" method receives its arguments; **this breaks compatibility with previous versions!**
-  fixed a bug where making mixed calls to the library's method would get you into trouble as options set by one method were not being unset by another
-  all types of requests can now be cached, not just "get" and "header" request
-  URLs can now also be processed in batches with [pause in between](https://stefangabos.github.io/Zebra_cURL/Zebra_cURL/Zebra_cURL.html#var$pause_interval); helpful for relieving stress on servers, if you are processing hundreds or more requests
-  any type of requests can now be processed at once, using the newly added [queue](https://stefangabos.github.io/Zebra_cURL/Zebra_cURL/Zebra_cURL.html#methodqueue) method
-  the library now also sets default value for the CURLOPT_ENCODING option to "gzip,deflate"
-  improved documentation

## version 1.2.1 (November 12, 2014)

- fixed an issue that appeared since PHP 5.3.0 where, because of how [htmlentities](http://php.net/manual/en/function.htmlentities.php) has changed since that version, the body of a fetched page would be an empty string the output would contain invalid code unit sequences within the given encoding (utf-8 in our case)
- fixed an issues in composer.json due to which the class was not registered for autoloading after installation, and the library now explicitly requires lib-curl; thanks to **Igor Denisenko**
- fixed some documentation issues; thanks to **Igor Denisenko**

## version 1.1.0 (June 26, 2014)

- fixed a bug where the "post" method was not working with callback functions

- callback functions may now return FALSE instructing the library to not cache the respective request; this makes it easy to retry failed requests without having to clear all cache
